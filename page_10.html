The regulatory authority report number is GB-MHRA-WEBCOVID-202103162223205360, Safety Report Unique Identifier GB-MHRA-ADR 24960761. A 32-year-old female patient received first dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, solution for injection, lot number: EK1768), via an unspecified route of administration on 13Jan2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included asthma, macroprolactinaemia and folic acid supplementation, all from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing and pregnancy (uneventful pregnancy) from 2019. The patient had one previous uneventful pregnancy with spontaneous vaginal delivery in 2019. Patient has not had symptoms associated with COVID-19. Patient was not enrolled in clinical trial. Patient was not currently breastfeeding. Concomitant medications included cabergoline taken for macroprolactinaemia from 15Jan2005 to 05Dec2020; and folic acid taken for folic acid supplementation, start and stop date were not reported. The patient experienced early miscarriage/miscarriage on 18Feb2021. The mother was 12 weeks pregnant at the onset of the event.  The mother was due to deliver on 28Aug2021. Last menstrual period (LMP) date was 21Nov2021 giving an estimated due date (EDD) of 28Aug2021. First vaccine dose was received on 13Jan2021 at 7+4 weeks gestation. Routine ultrasound scan on 16Feb2021 at what should have been 12+3 showed that the fetus had no heartbeat and had stopped growing at 8-9 weeks gestation, approximately 1-2 weeks after administration of the first vaccine dose. Natural miscarriage then began on 18Feb2021 and continued for approximately 5 days. It was unsure if the medicine has an adverse effect on any aspect of the pregnancy. The reporter assessed the event as serious (hospitalization, medically significant and congenital anomaly). Patient has not tested positive for COVID-19 since having the vaccine. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included COVID-19 virus test: negative (no/negative COVID-19 test) on an unspecified date, and ultrasound scan: missed miscarriage (should have been 12+3 showed that the fetus had no heartbeat and had stopped growing at 8-9 weeks gestation, approximately 1-2 weeks after administration of the first vaccine dose) on 16Feb2021. The outcome of the event was recovered with sequel on an unspecified date.  No follow up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.</p>  </td></tr>

<p style="margin:0"><b>Write-up:</b> Miscarriage on week 8-9; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable nurse (patient). A 30-year-old female patient received the first and second doses of BNT162B2 (COMIRNATY, Lot number and expiration date were not reported) as a single dose, with route of administration and therapy dates unspecified, for COVID-19 immunization. The patient had no relevant medical history and concomitant medications. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination. The patient had received the vaccine approximately on pregnancy weeks 2 and 5 (the patient did not know she was pregnant). The patient had a miscarriage on pregnancy week 8-9. This was diagnosed in ultrasound on pregnancy week 12. On ultrasounds performed in weeks 6 and 8, the fetus was normal and the heart rate was strong. It was not known what caused the miscarriage but the patient wanted to know if the relationship of the vaccine with miscarriages was investigated at some point. The patient had considered the reported event to be serious (medically significant). The patient had no other medications or illnesses, and was basically healthy. The mother reported she became pregnant while taking BNT162B2. The pregnancy resulted into spontaneous abortion. The fetal outcome was intrauterine death.; Sender''s Comments: Based on a reported drug event chronological association, the company cannot completely rule out a reasonable possibility that BNT162B2 (COMIRNATY) caused the miscarriages (PT: Abortion spontaneous).  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.</p>  </td></tr>

<p style="margin:0"><b>Write-up:</b> miscarriage; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician (patient) via COAVES. A 35-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), first dose via an unspecified route of administration, administered in arm left on Jan2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EL0203) as single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included concussion from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, and pregnancy was with IVF and her transfer date was 03Jan2021, day 5 embryo. The patient''s concomitant medications included unspecified medications.  The patient experienced miscarriage on 23Feb2021. The mother reported she became pregnant while taking bnt162b2. The mother was 8 Weeks pregnant at the onset of the event.  The mother was due to deliver on 21Sep2021. The pregnancy resulted in spontaneous abortion. The patient recovered from the event on an unspecified date. The patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19 prior to vaccination and has not been tested for COVID-19 since the vaccination.; Sender''s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Miscarriage cannot be totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.</p>  </td></tr>

A 32-year-old female patient received the first dose of bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE, Solution for injection, lot number: EK1768), via an unspecified route of administration, administered in Arm Left on 13Jan2021 at the age of 32 years old at single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included Macroprolactinoma, mild asthma, Allergies to medications, food, or other products: Penicillin. Concomitant medications included folic acid; colecalciferol (VITAMIN D [COLECALCIFEROL]). Facility where the most recent COVID-19 vaccine was administered was Hospital. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID vaccine. It was reported the Vaccine administered at 7+4 weeks gestation. In Feb2021, at the nuchal scan at 12+3 weeks it was confirmed that there was no heartbeat and it was estimated the baby had stopped growing at approx. 8+6 weeks, a week after the vaccine had been administered. In Feb2021, the miscarriage then started 2 days later which was 4 weeks after the baby had died (Jan2021) and 5 weeks after administration of the vaccine. The mother reported she became pregnant while taking BNT162B2. The mother was 12 Weeks pregnant at the onset of the event. The patient last menstrual period date was 21Nov2020. The mother was due to deliver on 28Aug2021. The adverse events result in Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit. Treatment was not received for the adverse events. Prior to vaccination, the patient was not diagnosed with COVID-19. Since the vaccination, the patient had been tested for COVID-19. The patient underwent lab tests and procedures which included polymerase chain reaction (PCR): Unknown results on an unspecified date; Lateral flow: unknown results on an unspecified date; nuchal scan: no heartbeat in Feb2021, it was estimated the baby had stopped growing at approx 8+6 weeks; Nasal Swab: negative on 18Feb2021, negative on 08Mar2021, negative on 12Mar2021, negative on 17Mar2021, negative on 20Mar2021. The outcome of the event "there was no heartbeat/ the miscarriage then started 2 days later which was 4 weeks after the baby had died and 5 weeks after administration of the vaccine" was unknown, of the other events was Recovered/Resolved with Sequel.; Sender''s Comments: As an individual case report there is not enough evidence to establish a causal relationship with the suspect vaccine. Currently there is no clear biological plausibility between the vaccine use and the even onset.    The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.</p>  </td></tr>

<p style="margin:0"><b>Write-up:</b> Spontaneous abortion at 8 weeks of gestation (about 2-3 weeks per ultrasound)/Early miscarriage; got pregnant in between the doses (natural way); This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer (patient) who reported events for both vaccination doses. The is the report for the second dose. The first report was downloaded from the Medicines Agency (MA) WEB regulatory authority number HR-HALMED-300044977.  A 35-year-old female patient received the second dose of bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY, lot number: EJ6136), intramuscular on 29Jan2021 as a single dose as protection against Covid 19 infection. Medical history included appendectomy in 2019, COVID-19 infection with mild clinical symptoms (2 days of fever) in from an unspecified date in 2020 to Nov2020. The patient did not have any other comorbidities, is a non-smoker and does not consume alcohol. The patient does not have allergies and has not given birth or had an abortion so far. The patient was not taking any permanent therapy. The patient''s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously received the first dose of bnt162b2 (lot number: EJ1491) on 04Jan2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced pain in her arm at the application site that lasted for 48 hours. Between the two doses the patient got pregnant the natural way in Jan2021. On 23Feb2021, the patient had an early miscarriage/spontaneous abortion at 8 weeks of gestation (about 2-3 weeks per ultrasound). The patient was hospitalized due to the event. The outcome of the event was recovering. Considering the lack of data in pregnant women from clinical trials and high incidence of spontaneous miscarriages in the first trimester of pregnancy, causal relationship between vaccine administration and spontaneous miscarriage cannot be assessed. Early miscarriage was assessed by the regulatory authority as "Unassessable/Unclassifiable" using WHO-UMC Causality method.  Sender''s comments: Additional information received on 23Mar2021. Vaccination site pain lasting 48 hours after administration of the first dose is reported. The reporter stated the following: "I have reported early miscarriage as ADR since clinical trials were not performed in pregnant women, although I completely understand that miscarriage could be or does not have to be related with vaccination."  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.</p>  </td></tr>

<p style="margin:0"><b>Write-up:</b> In an ultrasound check it showed a fetus with no heartbeat and no movement/ IUFD; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable other healthcare professional. This other healthcare professional reported information for both mother and fetus. This is the maternal report. A 40-year-old female patient received the first dose of BNT162B2 (COMIRNATY, Solution for injection, lot number and expiry date were not reported), via an unspecified route of administration, on 17Feb2021 at a single dose for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included thalassemia minor, varicose veins in the legs, slipped disc, simple ovarian cyst removal, and 6th pregnancy. The patient was pregnant at the time of vaccination, at 34 weeks age of gestation. Concomitant medications were not reported. After she felt lessening of fetal movement in the course of the night and in the morning, she woke up and did not feel fetal movement. Negated water secretion, labor or bleeding. This refers to a woman aged 40, healthy except for Thalassemia minor, Varicose veins in the legs, status after a slipped disc and simple ovarian cyst removal. The patient was in week 34+1 of her 6th pregnancy (3 children). According to the report, the pregnancy was spontaneous. Nuchal translucency screening was normal. Integrated test 1:800. Did not have an amniocentesis. Late (anatomy) ultrasound normal, normal OGTT. Growth rate week 32 summarized as normal. The day before (on 17Feb2021) received the first injection of the vaccine for COVID 19 in a community setting. When she was given it there was no fetal heartbeat. In an ultrasound check it showed a fetus with no heartbeat and no movement. PCR test for COVID 19 when she was admitted was negative. The patient gave birth on 19Feb2021 in the evening and the fetus was without external birth defects except for syndactyly in fingers 4-5 in the right leg. Even with request and repeated explanation, the woman refused an autopsy but agreed to a genetic test, x-rays, medical photographs and histological check of the placenta in addition to a corona test from the placenta and from the fetus. Reason for hospitalization/diagnosis on hospitalization was IUFD (intrauterine fetal death). At the time of report, patient hospitalization status was "released". Outcome of the event was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible, information about lot/batch number cannot be obtained.; Sender''s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event Stillbirth cannot be totally excluded.  It is possible that there was no fetal heartbeat prior to administrating the vaccine (When she was given it there was no fetal heartbeat.). The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.,Linked Report(s) : IL-PFIZER INC-2021348948 Fetus case</p>  </td></tr>

A 42-years-old female patient received bnt162b2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), dose 1 via an unspecified route of administration on 16Mar2021  as single dose for covid-19 immunisation.

The patient did the first vaccination on 16Mar2021 while patient was pregnant for 7+3 weeks. on 05Apr2021, the patient found out baby has no pulse. According to ultrasound measurements, the size of baby corresponds to week 7. Since baby had a pulse 2 days before the vaccination, at week 7+1, they believe baby died a few days after, meaning after the vaccination. Patient know that miscarriages in the first trimester are very common and especially after the age of 40, and that it may very well have nothing to do with the vaccine other than a coincidence but it seemed important to patient to update. The outcome of events was unknown.  Information on the lot/batch number has been requested.; Sender''s Comments: Considering a plausible temporal association between the reported events of Spontaneous Abortion and the suspect drug BNT162B2 cannot be excluded. The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events.  Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.</p>  </td></tr>

A 38-year-old female patient received the second dose of BNT162B2 (PFIZER-BIONTECH COVID-19 VACCINE), via an unspecified route of administration on 01Mar2021 (Lot Number: EJ0553) as single dose for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included suppressed lactation, miscarriage, pregnancy, details of previous pregnancies reported was otherwise healthy, no issues. (patient no longer pregnant at the time of reporting), folic acid supplementation, and constipation. Patient has not had symptoms associated with COVID-19. Patient is not enrolled in clinical trial. Patient is not currently breastfeeding. Concomitant medications included progesterone (CYCLOGEST) taken for pregnancy from 14Jan2021 to 31Mar2021; estradiol (EVOREL) taken for pregnancy from 14Jan2021 to 31Mar2021; folic acid (FOLIC ACID) taken for folic supplementation, start and stop date were not reported; plantago ovata (FYBOGEL) taken for constipation from 20Mar2021 to an unspecified stop date; ascorbic acid, betacarotene, biotin, calcium pantothenate, colecalciferol, copper, cyanocobalamin, folic acid, iodine, iron, magnesium, nicotinamide, phytomenadione, pyridoxine hydrochloride, riboflavin, selenium, thiamine mononitrate, tocopheryl acid succinate, zinc (PREGNACARE ORIGINAL) taken for pregnancy from 01Jan2021 to an unspecified stop date; estradiol valerate (PROGYNOVA) taken for pregnancy from 04Jan2021 to 31Mar2021.

Patient had healthy scan at 7w+3 which showed CRL 10mm and heartbeat on 01Mar2021. She then had Pfizer 2nd dose on 04Mar2021. Her subsequent scan on 31Mar2021 showed no heartbeat and a CRL of 8.2mm. The fact that the CRL had shrunk implies the embryo died soon after the 8 week scan. Although this may be entirely unrelated to the Pfizer vaccine that she had, she thought she should report this for data gathering purposes. Patient has not tested positive for COVID-19 since having the vaccine. Unsure if the medicine have an adverse effect on any aspect of the pregnancy.

The anatomical scans during pregnancy were normal. In the emergency room, a fetus was found without a pulse, a normal amount of amniotic fluid, an estimated weight of 2700 grams. Are interested in performing a genetic test.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information expected; Sender''s Comments: Based on the current available information and the plausible drug-event temporal association, a possible contributory role of the suspect product BNT162B2 to the development of event cannot be  totally excluded.  The case will be reassessed if additional information becomes available.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to Regulatory Authorities, Ethics Committees and Investigators, as appropriate.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: IUFD</p>  </td></tr>

The patient had recovered from the miscarriage on 14Apr2021.   The reporter''s assessment of the causal relationship of the events with suspect product, BNT162b2 was not provided at the time of this report. Since no determination has been received, the case is managed based on the company causality assessment.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.; Sender''s Comments: The Company cannot completely exclude the possible causality between the reported miscarriage, exposure during pregnancy and the administration of the COVID 19 vaccine, BNT162B2, based on the known safety profile and reasonable temporal association.  The impact of this report on the benefit/risk profile of the Pfizer product is evaluated as part of Pfizer procedures for safety evaluation, including the review and analysis of aggregate data for adverse events. Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to RAs, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.</p>  </td></tr>

It was reported that the conception will have occurred on the 15th or 16th of January 2021 and the date of the diagnosis of the retained abortion was 23Mar2021, in which it would have 11 weeks and 3 days by ultrasound dating and the embryo had a craniocaudal length compatible with 10 weeks, that was, the abortion had occurred a week and a few days before the diagnosis on 23Mar2021. All events with the medically significant. Lab data include patient body temperature was 38.2 centigrade on 27Jan2021. Specific treatment of the reaction was carried out, "subfebrile (maximum 38.2 tympanic), headache, myalgia and arthralgia", with Ibuprofen 600 mg and Paracetamol 1000 mg.

Then she began bleeding quite light then clots appeared on an unspecified date in 2021. The patient went to the hospital on an unspecified date in 2021 but has been told it was too late; she suffered a miscarriage on 17Mar2021 which the physician attributed to blood clot causing the fetus to suffocate. The physician believed the blood clot may have been caused by her receiving the vaccine in the early stages of the pregnancy. The reporter stated that they would like to try again but was concerned that it will happen again. The reporter also queried on how long they should wait to try for a baby, if the patient had the booster. They were referred to speak with their physician on when they should consider attempting to conceive again. The patient wanted to speak with someone at Pfizer to see if the company would have any additional recommendations on when they should attempt to become pregnant again.
