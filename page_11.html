The physician reported events for 2 doses, this is the first of two reports, regarding events after second dose. A 26-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY), dose 2 intramuscular, at age 26 years, on 02Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: ET7205) as 2ND DOSE, SINGLE for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included already had 2 pregnancies without abnormalities (2016 and 2017). The patient''s concomitant medications were not reported. Patient historically took first dose of COMIRNATY (Lot# EP9605) on 08Mar2021 for COVID-19 immunization and experienced maternal exposure during pregnancy. Patient who has  3rd pregnancy taking place so far without any particular problem. Termination of pregnancy was noted during an ultrasound performed on 13Apr2021 (as reported, Time Interval between Beginning of Drug Administration and Start of Reaction / Event / Abortion spontaneous was also reported as 12 days) at 16 weeks with estimated date of termination of pregnancy at 14weeks. No abnormality identified but the stage of pregnancy is too early to see a possible malformation. The gynaecologist is surprised at the termination of pregnancy at this unusual stage. An anatomopathological analysis has been requested but will not be available for several weeks. Conclusion was spontaneous miscarriage at 14 weeks and post vaccination. The outcome was unknown, favorable for the patient.   No follow-up attempts are possible.

This physician reported information for both mother and baby. This is the maternal report. A 36-year-old pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY), intramuscular on 19May2021 (Batch/Lot number was not reported) as unknown dose, single for covid-19 immunisation. The patient''s patient medical and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was not diagnosed with covid-19 prior to vaccination. The patient''s last menstrual period was 17Sep2020. The patient did not receive any other vaccines within 4 weeks prior to the COVID-19 vaccine. It was reported that a pregnant patient received Comirnaty on 19May2021 who is at 34 weeks gestation with the expected date of delivery of 24Jun2021. The patient went into premature labor and had the baby at 35 weeks and 1 day of gestation, 2 days after receiving the vaccine (21May2021). It was further reported that 5 days after delivery (May2021) the patient had an important hemorrhage and was hospitalized (in May2021) for 7 days and needed blood transfusion. She has now been diagnosed with thrombosis in her arm (May2021). It was reported that the adverse events required Doctor or other healthcare professional office/clinic visit and emergency room/department or urgent care. The adverse events were assessed as serious with seriousness criterion of hospitalization and life-threatening illness. The patient received treatment for the adverse events. The patient has not been tested for Covid-19 since vaccination. The mother was due to deliver on 24Jun2021. The mother delivered the pregnancy on 21May2021. The baby was delivered premature. The patient went into premature labor and had the baby at 35 weeks and 1 day of gestation (21May2021). The outcome of the events was recovered on May2021 with sequelae.  Information on the batch number has been requested.; Sender''s Comments: Based on the temporal relationship, the association between the reported events with COMIRNATY use can not be fully excluded.

<p style="margin:0"><b>Write-up:</b> birth of a dead foetus; This is a spontaneous report received from a contactable physician downloaded from the Regulatory Authority-WEB. The regulatory authority report number is HU-OGYI-334521.  A 33-year-old female patient in her 35th week of gravidity received bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY), dose 1 intramuscular, administered in arm left on 16Apr2021 (Batch/Lot Number: EW9127) as 0.3 ml single at the age of 33-year-old for COVID-19 immunisation.  Medical history included ongoing cholestasis of pregnancy. Concomitant medication(s) included ursodeoxycholic acid (URSOFALK) taken for cholestasis of pregnancy, start and stop date were not reported. With therapy, her liver enzyme values were satisfactory, serum bilirubin was normal. The patient experienced birth of a dead foetus on 22Apr2021. The mother reported she became pregnant while taking bnt162b2. The mother was 35 weeks pregnant at the onset of the event. The foetus died on an unspecified date.  It was not reported if an autopsy was performed. The course of events was as follows: On 20Apr2021 in the evening, the patient started to have abdominal pain, which was similar to menstrual cramps. She was not bleeding, seepage of amniotic fluid was not detected. On 21Apr2021, she has felt foetal movements. On 22Apr2021, she went to the delivery room because of irregular labour-pains, where intrauterine death was verified.  Based on the opinion of the patient''s hepatologist, the cholestasis was mild, and URSOFALK was not likely to have contributed to the event. He assumed relationship between the vaccination and foetal death.  #Further information is expected.  Sender Comment: Foetal death occurred in a female patient vaccinated in the 35th week of her gravidity with the first dose of COMIRNATY. To take out (medicines given to patient on discharge from hospital stay) was 4 days for the beginning of symptoms, and 6 days for foetal death. The patient had cholestasis of pregnancy, and had to take URSOFALK, which might have been also harmful for the foetus. Based on the above, causality between foetal death and COMIRNATY is possible. The case is serious because the foetus died. Further information is expected.  No follow-up attempts possible. No further information expected.; Reported Cause(s) of Death: foetal death</p>  </td></tr>

<p style="margin:0"><b>Write-up:</b> Strong uterine contraction, even 18, daily; The cervix softened; in her 24th week of pregnancy received the first dose of COMIRNATY; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable consumer downloaded from the Regulatory Authority-WEB, regulatory authority number HU-OGYI-364821.   A 31-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY), dose 1 intramuscular on 30Mar2021 (the age of 31 years old) (Batch/Lot Number: Unknown) as 0.3ml single dose for covid-19 immunisation. Medical history included labour 6 years before. The patient''s concomitant medications were not reported.  On 02Apr2021, the patient experienced strong uterine contraction, even 18, daily; cervix softened. It was reported that: On 30Mar2021, the 31 years old female patient in her 24th week of pregnancy received the first dose of COMIRNATY. On 02Apr2021, the patient started to have strong uterine contractions, which occurred frequently, up to 18 times a day. As a result, she has cervix dystocia on 02Apr2021. Dosage of magnesium was elevated and she received progesterone as well. The symptoms had not resolved and she had to stay in bed since then. The patient did not have any chronic diseases or regular medicines. She had a labour 6 years before; that time no complication had emerged. In the current pregnancy until the 24th week, there were no complications, either. The patient had not had COVID-19. The outcome of Strong uterine contraction and Cervix dystocia was not recovered.  Sender''s Comments: Uterine contraction and cervix dystocia are not expected adverse events of COMIRNATY. Time-trade-off (TTO) was 3 days for the start of the symptoms. Based on the above, causality between the events and COMIRNATY is possible. The case is serious. Further information is expected.

A 27-year-old pregnant female patient received BNT162b2 (COMIRNATY, Solution for injection, Lot number- unknown) during periconceptional period via an unspecified route of administration in Mar2021 (either on 30Mar2021 or on 31Mar2021) as dose 1 single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history and concomitant medications were not reported. The patient was not sure about the exact date. In the end of May2021 (after the first dose of vaccine), the patient experienced a miscarriage. It had been over 2 months, that the patient did not get her second dose of vaccine. So, the reporter asked if the patient must receive the second dose of vaccine. Then the reporter asked if the patient should receive a dose of JANSSEN vaccine. The reporter also asked if it was useful to do a serology test. The outcome of the events was unknown.; Sender''s Comments: A causal association between BNT162B2 and the reported miscarriage with exposure during pregnancy cannot be completely excluded based on information provided. The case will be reassessed once new information is available.

Any safety concern identified as part of this review, as well as any appropriate action in response, will be promptly notified to regulatory authorities, Ethics Committees, and Investigators, as appropriate.</p>  </td></tr>
