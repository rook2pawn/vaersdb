<p style="margin:0"><b>Write-up:</b> Miscarriage in the 9th week of pregnancy (missed abortion); This is a spontaneous report from a non-contactable consumer downloaded from a regulatory authority-WEB. The regulatory authority report number is DE-PEI-CADR2021066808. Additional reference numbers included: DE-CADRPEI-2021066808 and DE-PEI-202100059889. A 33-year-old female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY; Batch/Lot Number: EL8723), via an unspecified route of administration, on 15Feb2021, as dose 2, single for COVID-19 immunisation. Medical history included  a delivery from an unknown date and unknown wherein the patient has given birth to two healthy children. The patient has no known allergies, no risk factors and pre-existing conditions. On 26Apr2021, it was reported that on 15Feb2021, the patient received the second vaccine dose and Early to mid-March the patient was became pregnant. (The first day of her last period was 25Feb2021). The first positive pregnancy test was on 25Mar2021. The patient had her first appointment with the gynaecologist on 15Apr20a21. An amniotic sac and the yolk sac were visible on ultrasound, however, a heartbeat could not yet be detected. At the next follow-up appointment in the 9th week of pregnancy (on 26Apr2021) it was established that the embryo was no longer alive (missed abortion). On 29Apr2021 a womb scrape (curettage) was thereupon carried out in hospital. No explainable causes were found for the miscarriage. The patient was aware that pregnancy terminations often happened during early pregnancy. However, as the patient had not suffered a miscarriage until then and have given birth to two healthy children, the patient reported the incident. Even if the patient did not assume that the incident has anything to do with the vaccination, she still considered it sensible to report such serious events that have taken place within a short time of the vaccination. The outcome of the event was recovered on unspecified date in 2021.  No follow-up attempts are possible. No further information is expected.</p>  </td></tr>

<p style="margin:0"><b>Write-up:</b> Foetal death in utero; Maternal Exposure During Pregnancy, third trimester ; Miscarriage; Chorioamnionitis; This is a spontaneous report from a contactable physician downloaded from the regulatory authority-WEB [FR-AFSSAPS-TS20212485], Safety Report Unique Identifier [FR-AFSSAPS-2021078733].   A 38-year-old pregnant female patient received bnt162b2 (COMIRNATY), intramuscular on 21May2021 (Lot number: unknown) as dose 1, single for COVID-19 immunization. Medical history included in vitro fertilization. The patient''s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took magnesium. The patient experienced foetal death in utero (hospitalization on unspecified date) on 06Jun2021, and miscarriage on 05Jun2021; both events resulted in emergency room visit. This mother reported her last menstrual period was on 08Nov2020 (as reported). The mother reported she became pregnant while taking bnt162b2 (Maternal Exposure During Pregnancy, third trimester).  The mother was 28 weeks pregnant at the onset of the event.  Course of events as follows: The patient who started a pregnancy on 22Nov2020 by in vitro fertilization (as reported). Twin chorionic, bi-amniotic twin pregnancy. Normal clinical and ultrasound course on unspecified date. Last ultrasound on 21May2021: normal. 10% weight discrepancy between the 2 fetuses, which is not an anomaly in the context of twin pregnancy. Last obstetric consultation (27May2021) normal. Emergency consultation on Saturday 05Jun2021 in the evening (D15 post-vaccine) for premature rupture of the membranes, spontaneous, without associated sign: frank rupture, clear liquid, no fever, no contraction, no other symptom. On ultrasound on 06Jun2021, fetal death in utero of one of the 2 twins (dating back several days, because signs of maceration and anamnios), good vitality of the other twin. The mother had not noticed any particular symptoms and felt her babies moving (difficulty assessing due to twin pregnancy?) On 06Jun2021, Normal blood pressure and heart rate, no fever (normal body temperature), no proteinuria. Start of amoxicillin (will not be not continued after birth). A few hours after admission, onset of contractions. Birth by cesarean on 06Jun2021 at 9:11 a.m., under cover of 2 g of cefazoline, of the first baby, alive, male, weighing 1.34 kg with normal pH then 1 minute later of the second baby, deceased, weighing 1.16 kg, with clear signs of maceration. Obstetricians noted that each child''s umbilical cords were very large and very swollen. For the living baby, however, the fluid was clear and no other peculiarities were observed. Baby hospitalized for prematurity, no infectious problem. Bacteriology on the placenta: rare leukocytes, direct negative examination, sterile culture. Biological assessment in the mother on unspecified date: CRP at 27 mg/L, normal coagulation assessment, hemoglobin 9.7 g/dL, platelets 254 G/L, leukocytes 10 G/L (but pregnancy). Sterile ECBU and vaginal sample. Hepatitis B, C, HIV, HTLV 1 and 2 serology negative, parvovirus and toxoplasmosis in favor of an old infection. Anti-cardiolipid and anti-beta 2 GPI antibodies negative. Anti-erythrocytic antibodies negative. Foetopathological examination: normal (male fetus, macerated, without apparent or visceral malformation detected, no dysmorphia of the face or extremities). No malformative cause identified likely to explain this MFIU. Pathological examinations of the 2 placentas: histological appearance in accordance with the term, presence of stage 2 chorioamnionitis with stage 3 funniculitis for the deceased twin, less intense chorioamnionitis without funniculitis for the other twin. In total, fetal death in utero of one of 2 twins in a twin chorionic, bi-amniotic twin pregnancy, discovered at 30 weeks on D15 of a first dose of Comirnaty, after premature rupture of the frank membranes of clear liquid, without fever or contraction. Aspect of maceration of the deceased twin suggesting a death dating back several days. Premature delivery in the following hours by Caesarean section of a live male child hospitalized for prematurity and of the deceased child. Chorioamnionitis for the 2 twins (stage 2 with stage 3 funniculitis for the deceased twin, less intense for the other) on anatomopathological examination of the placentas, no abnormality on fetopathological examination of the deceased twin. The outcome of the event foetal death in utero was resolved with sequel and the outcome of the remaining events was unknown.  No follow-up attempts are possible; information on batch/lot number cannot be obtained. No further information is expected.</p>  </td></tr>

This consumer reported information for both mother and fetus. This is the maternal report.  A 32-year-old female patient received second dose of BNT162B2 (COMIRNATY), intramuscular on 07May2021 (Lot Number: EW6126) as 0.3 ml, single dose for covid-19 immunisation.  Medical history included endometriosis from 2020, pregnancy from 2012 (proceeded normally and ended with the birth of a healthy child at 41 + 6 weeks of pregnancy). The patient''s concomitant medications were not reported. The patient previously took progesterone tablets for endometriosis in 2020. The patient was vaccinated with the second dose of Comirnaty vaccine on 07May2021. Next day on 08May2021 developed fatigue, weakness, muscle pain and the skin was sore. Patient also experienced hyperaesthesia on 08May2021. On 10May2021, the patient discovered that she was pregnant. On 04Jun2021, the pregnancy terminated spontaneously. All this time was abdominal pain. The tests were OK, only the level of progesterone was very low. Eventually, the fetal heart stopped and the pregnancy interrupted. The patient used paracetamol, ibuprofen, to treat the side effects. The condition was improving. She had no concomitant diseases, allergies, medications. Fatigue lasted for a few weeks, the rest (weakness, muscle pain and skin soreness) for 2-3 days. Abdominal pain was from 10May2021 to abortion on 04Jun2021. On 02Jun2021, the patient went emergency department due to bleeding. Progesterone analysis was performed: 16.7 nmol/l. Gepretix (progesterone) 1 capsule orally three times a day was prescribed. The size of the pregnancy at that time was 4 weeks, at the time of abortion (04Jun2021)-7 + 2.  The patient took ibuprofen (600 mg x 3) when the pregnancy began to terminate (from June 4th), previously took paracetamol (1 g x 4) and drotaverine (80 mg x 2) due to pain. The previous pregnancy was in 2012, proceeded normally and ended with the birth of a healthy child at 41 + 6 weeks of pregnancy. There have been no abortions. In the autumn of 2020, progesterone tablets were prescribed because endometriosis was detected because the menstrual cycle was very painful. After a few months, everything returned to normal and the patient stopped treatment. The outcome of the event "pregnancy terminated spontaneously" was recovered on 04Jun2021, event abdominal pain was recovered on 04Jun2021, event muscle pain was recovered on 10May2021, event fatigue was recovered on 22May2021, event weakness was recovered on 10May2021, event hyperaesthesia was recovered on 10May2021, event "the level of progesterone was very lo/Progesterone analysis was performed: 16.7 nmol/l" was recovering, events "skin was sore/skin soreness" and bleeding was unknown.  Sender Comment: Serious report due to miscarriage (medically significant). The initial side effects are known, the causal link is considered possible. Previous gynecological problems (endometriosis) may have contributed to the termination of the pregnancy.  No follow-up attempts are possible.

Medical history included abortion spontaneous from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing, pregnancy from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing (Patient no longer pregnant at the time of reporting), ongoing breast feeding and anxiety from an unknown date and unknown if ongoing. Concomitant medications included folic acid (Manufacture Unknown) taken for an unspecified indication, start and stop date were not reported; sertraline (Manufacture Unknown) taken for anxiety state, start and stop date were not reported. On an unspecified date, the patient experienced irregular periods, light spotting occured throughout early pregnancy, miscarriage/early miscarriage. The outcome of the event ''miscarriage/early miscarriage'' was recovering. The outcome of the events ''irregular periods'' and ''light spotting occured throughout early pregnancy'' was recovered on an unspecified date.  The clinical course was reported as follows: Vaccine given on 01Jun2021 around the time of conception. Light spotting occurred throughout early pregnancy, then a full miscarriage 3-4 weeks later. Possibly completely unrelated but the patient saw a lot of people reporting heavier or irregular periods after the vaccine so wondered if the vaccine and miscarriage could be connected. Patient has not tested positive for COVID-19 since having the vaccine.  Additional information: Unsure if the medicine has an adverse effect on any aspect of the pregnancy. Patient did not take folic acid supplement during pregnancy. Patient was exposed to the medicine first-trimester (1-12 weeks).
